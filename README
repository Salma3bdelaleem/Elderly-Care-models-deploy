# Smart Elderly Care System

This project integrates three AI models to enhance elderly safety and healthcare monitoring:

- [Fall Detection](fall_detection) – Deep learning model.
- [Activity Classification](activity_classification) – Machine Learning model using accelerometer sensor data.
- [Health Monitoring](health_monitoring) – Vital signs classification into three risk levels.

All models were deployed using **FastAPI, Docker, DockerHub, and Azure Cloud**, and integrated into a mobile application for real-time monitoring and caregiver alerts.
