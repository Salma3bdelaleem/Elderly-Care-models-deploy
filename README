# 🧓💡 Smart Elderly Care System  

This project integrates three AI models to enhance elderly safety and healthcare monitoring:  

- 🤖 **Fall Detection** – Deep Learning model.  
- 📊 **Activity Classification** – Machine Learning model using accelerometer sensor data.  
- ❤️ **Health Monitoring** – Vital signs classification into three risk levels.  

All models were deployed using **FastAPI, Docker, DockerHub, and Azure Cloud**, and integrated into a mobile application for **real-time monitoring** and **caregiver alerts**.
